# TidyHome Project Context for Claude Code

## Project Overview
- React + Vite + TypeScript application
- Server runs on port 5000 (not 3000)
- Located at: C:\Projects\tidyhome-git

## Brand Guidelines
### Typography
- Headers: MarlideDisplay (in /client/public/fonts/)
- Body/Subtitles: Bicyclette Regular, Bold, Light variants
- Apply generous spacing between elements

### Color Palette
- Alabaster (#eeeae1) - Primary background (replaces ALL white)
- Ebony (#555843) - Dark sections
- Sage (#bfbf82) - Primary brand
- Brown Sugar (#e08446) - CTAs and accents
- Kobicha (#5e432c) - Footer/elegant sections
- Ruddy Blue (#92a7d3) - Secondary

## Critical Requirements
1. NEVER use pure white (#FFFFFF) - always use Alabaster
2. Services page must have Ebony background
3. All CTAs say "Connect With Us" not "Contact Us"
4. "YOUR SPACE MATTERS" should be 40% larger than normal headers
5. Show business hours with clock icon, NOT phone number
6. All services open as MODALS, not separate pages

## File Structure
- Images: /attached_assets/ (aliased as @assets)
- Fonts: /client/public/fonts/
- Components: /client/src/components/
- Pages: /client/src/pages/

## Current Tasks Status
