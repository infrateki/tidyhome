### ABOUT

## The Journey

Tidy Home began as a small, boutique home organization service with one clear goal; to help clients create calm, beautiful spaces they could truly enjoy. Over time, our passion for organization and client care led us to expand both our expertise and our reach. What started as helping organize a single room has grown into offering full-home transformations and complete lifestyle support, always with the same attention to detail and personal touch that defined us from the start.
